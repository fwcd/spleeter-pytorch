# spleeter-pytorch

Spleeter implementation in PyTorch.

## Usage

See [`test_estimator.py`](./test_estimator.py) for an example.

## Note

* I only tested with 2stems model, not sure if it works for other models.
* There might be some bugs, the quality of output isn't as good as the original. See [output](./output) for some results. If someone found the reason, please open a pull request. Thanks.
